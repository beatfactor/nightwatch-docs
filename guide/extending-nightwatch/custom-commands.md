### Writing Custom Commands

Most of the time you will need to extend the Nightwatch commands to suit your own application needs. Doing that is only a matter of creating a separate folder and defining your own commands inside, each in its own file.

Then specify the path to that folder in the `nightwatch.json` file, as the `custom_commands_path` property. The command name is the name of the file itself.

There are two main ways in which you can define a custom command:

#### 1) Function-style commands
This is the simplest form in which commands are defined, however they are also quite limited. 

The command module needs to export a `command` function, which needs to call at least one Nightwatch api method (such as `.execute()`). This is due to a limitation of how the asynchronous queueing system of commands works. You can also wrap everything in a `.perform()` call. Client commands like `execute` and `perform` are available via `this`.

```JavaScript
exports.command = function(file, callback) {
  var self = this;
  var imageData;
  var fs = require('fs');

  try {
    var originalData = fs.readFileSync(file);
    var base64Image = new Buffer(originalData, 'binary').toString('base64');
    imageData = 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + base64Image;
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
    throw "Unable to open file: " + file;
  }

  this.execute(
    function(data) { // execute application specific code
      App.resizePicture(data);
      return true;
    },

    [imageData], // arguments array to be passed

    function(result) {
      if (typeof callback === "function") {
        callback.call(self, result);
      }
    }
  );

  return this;
};
```

The example above defines a command (e.g. resizePicture.js) which loads an image file as `data-URI` and calls a method named `resizePicture` (via `.execute()`), defined inside the application.

With this command, the test will look something like:

```JavaScript
module.exports = {
  "testing resize picture" : function (browser) {
    browser
      .url("http://app.host")
      .waitForElementVisible("body")
      .resizePicture("/var/www/pics/moon.jpg")
      .assert.element(".container .picture-large")
      .end();
  }
};
```

#### 2) Class-style commands
This is how most of the Nightwatch's own commands are written. Your command module needs to export a class constructor with a `command` instance method representing the command function. Commands written like this should inherit from `EventEmitter` and manually signal the `complete` event, to indicate command completion.

Class-based `command` methods are run in the context (the value of `this`) of the class instance. The `browser` object is available as `this.api`.

The example below is the `.pause()` command, written as an ES6 class:

```JavaScript
const EventEmitter = require('events');

class Pause extends EventEmitter {
  command(ms, cb) {
    // If we don't pass the milliseconds, the client will
    // be suspended indefinitely
    if (!ms) {
      return this;
    }
    
    setTimeout(() => {
      // if we have a callback, call it right before the complete event
      if (cb) {
        cb.call(this.api);
      }
  
      this.emit('complete');
    }, ms);
  
    return this;
  }
} 

module.exports = Pause;
```

<br>
##### The "complete" event
Signaling the `complete` event needs to be done inside an asynchronous action (e.g. a `setTimeout` call). Command classes that do not extend `EventEmitter` will be treated similar to command functions, requiring that the `command` method calls at least one Nightwatch api method to be able to complete.
