## SafariDriver

The `safaridriver` binary is already installed on recent versions of Mac OS, however some manual configuration is needed before tests can be run against Safari.

You will need to run the following once, before using the safaridriver:

<pre><code class="language-bash">safaridriver --enable</code></pre>
