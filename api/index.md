Nightwatch works by loading all the necessary commands, settings, and other properties on a single API object which is made available at runtime to all test scripts as the single argument.
This is so that everything is ready to get started with writing the actual test script and not have to instantiate other objects.

### The "browser" object
We are referring to the main API object as `browser` â€“ for consistency with other Selenium related JS test frameworks and also because since v2, it is also available as a `global`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  demoTest: function (browser) {
    browser.init();
  }
};
```

You might also see examples from previous versions of Nightwatch, using `client`. It is of course perfectly fine, although it might be confusing to users who are new to JavaScript syntax. 

```javascript
module.exports = {
  demoTest: function (client) {
    client.init();
  }
};
```

#### Using as Global
From Nightwatch 2, `browser` is available as a global, so this is also valid:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  demoTest: function () {
    browser.init();
  }
};
```

As well as this:

```javascript
describe('Nightwatch APIs', function() {
  it('demoTest', function () {
    browser.init();
  })
};
```

  Other aliases are: `base_url`, `launch_url`, or `launchUrl`.

- #### actions

  Type: `function actions(options?: { async?: boolean; bridge?: boolean }): Actions`

  Returns a new instance of the `Actions` class from Selenium. See the [User Actions API](https://v2.nightwatchjs.org/api/useractions/) section for details.

- #### capabilities

  Type: `object`

  The WebDriver session capabilities, used by the browser driver to communicate the features supported.
  
  WebDriver capabilities are used to communicate the features supported by a session. A client may also use capabilities to define which features it requires the driver to satisfy when creating a new session.

  When a WebDriver session is created it returns a set of capabilities describing the negotiated, effective capabilities of the session. Some of the capabilities included in this set are standard and shared between all browsers, but the set may also contain browser-specific capabilities and these are always prefixed.
  More on [WebDriver Capabilities](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Capabilities).
  
  ###### Example:
  ```javascript
  {
    acceptInsecureCerts: false,
    browserName: 'chrome',
    browserVersion: '96.0.4664.55',
    'goog:chromeOptions': { debuggerAddress: 'localhost:50427' },
    // ... continued
  }
  ```

- #### currentTest

  Type: `NightwatchTestSuite`

  An object containing information about the current running testcase.

  ###### Available properties:

  ```javascript
  {
    // name of the current running testcase
    name: ' ... ',
    // name of the current running testsuite, i.e. the test file
    module: ' ... ',
    // name of the current running test group, if any
    group: '', 
    // the results object is shared among all testcases in the current testsuite
    results: {
      time: 0,
      assertions: [Array],
      passed: 0,
      errors: 0,
      failed: 0,
      retries: [Number],
      skipped: 0,
      tests: 0,
      steps: [],
      stackTrace: '',
      // an object accumulating the results of each testcase
      testcases: [Object]
    },
    // the current timestamp, in the format: Wed, 01 Dec 2021 08:34:00 GMT
    timestamp: ''
  }
  ```

- #### desiredCapabilities

  Type: `NightwatchDesiredCapabilities`

  An object containing the capabilities sent by Nightwatch to WebDriver, as defined in the Nightwatch config file (see the [Configuration section](http://local-v2.nightwatchjs.org/guide/configuration/overview.html) for details).

  ###### Example:

  ```javascript
  {
    browserName: 'chrome',
    'goog:chromeOptions': {},
    name: 'Example Test'
  }
  ```

- #### driver

  Type: `WebDriver`

  The [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/index_exports_WebDriver.html) instance which Nightwatch uses under the hood. Can be useful in custom commands when it is needed to extend the main functionality offered by Nightwatch.
  If uses in regular testcase scripts, this needs to be wrapped in a `.perform()` command.

  ###### Example:

  In the below example we will retrieve the [WebDriver Session](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/lib/session_exports_Session.html) instance.

  ```javascript
  describe('Nightwatch APIs', function() {
    it('driver demoTest', async function () {
      const session = await browser
        .init()
        .perform(function() {
          return this.driver.getSession();
        });
    })
  };
  ```

- #### sessionId

  Type: `string`

  The WebDriver session ID. WebDriver gives each session a unique session ID that can be used to differentiate one session from another. More info on WebDriver session is available on the [W3C WebDriver page](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#sessions) and the [Selenium WebDriver Docs](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/).

  ###### Example

  ```javascript
  console.log(browser.sessionId); // e0b40362dcec8ec501ac2b42b62bdce2
  ```

- #### globals

  Type: `NightwatchGlobals`

  The processed Nightwatch globals object which contains all the currently global properties and methods. See the [Test Globals section](https://v2.nightwatchjs.org/guide/using-nightwatch/concepts.html#using-test-globals) for details.
  
- #### options

  Type: `NightwatchOptions`

  The processed Nightwatch config object which contains all the currently used properties and settings. See the [Configuration section](https://nightwatchjs.org/guide/reference/settings.html) for details.
  
- #### Keys

  Type: `NightwatchKeys`

  A link to the [Key](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/index_exports_Key.html) enumeration from Selenium, which contains all the pressable keys that aren't text. This is usually needed when working with commands that send text to a page, like `.sendKeys()`.
  
- #### page

  Type: `NightwatchPage & NightwatchCustomPageObjects`

  Contains a dictionary of the current page objects, created for the currently running testcase.
  See [Working with Page Objects](https://v2.nightwatchjs.org/guide/working-with-page-objects/using-page-objects.html) section for details.
