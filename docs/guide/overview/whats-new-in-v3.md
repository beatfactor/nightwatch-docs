<div class="page-header"><h1>What's new in Nightwatch v3?</h1></div>

Nightwatch v3 brings in plenty of new features accross your testing workflow from authoring to executing to debugging tests. 

### New Features
<br>

#### [Nightwatch inspector][1]

Nightwatch v3 introduces a point and click tool that can help you easily find selectors. It will improve your productivity of authoring tests & help you find durable selectors for lower long term maintenance.

#### [Angular Component testing][2]

Nightwatch v3 has added support for Angular component testing to the [component testing][3] repertoire.s

#### [Test doubles][4]

With earlier versions, you could run [unit & integration tests][5] using Nightwatch. Nightwatch v3 introduces test doubles with in-build support for stubs, spies & mocks to achieve isolation in unit testing. 

#### Brand new element APIs

With Nightwatch v3, we have revamped the element API to make test authoring simpler and more concise. 

#### More rich & powerful selectors

New selectors are introduced as part of this latest versions
1. `.findByText()`
2. `.findByPlaceholderText()`
3. `.findByAltText()`
4. `.findByRole()`

You can also chain selectors to find elements that are more complex to find

**Example:**

<div class="sample-test"><pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript">browser.element.find('#selector').findByText('text').click();
</code></pre></div>

### Performance improvements

Nightwatch v3 has implemented worker threads for parallel runs and we have observed improvements of upto 25% between Nightwatch v2 & v3. [Try it now][6]

### Breaking changes
We have tried to ensure that there are no breaking changes while upgrading to v3. However, in case you need migration assistance please reach out to us on our new [Nightwatch v3 channel on Discord][7]
