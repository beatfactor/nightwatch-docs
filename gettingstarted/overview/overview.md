<h3 id="what-is-nightwatch-"><span>What is Nightwatch?</span></h3><p class="whatis-logo"><img src="/images/nightwatch-circle.png" alt="Nightwatch.js" title="Nightwatch.js" class="whatis"></p>

Nightwatch.js is an automated end-to-end testing framework for web applications and websites. It is written in [Node.js][1] and uses the [W3C WebDriver API][2] (formerly [Selenium WebDriver][3]) for interacting with various browsers.

<p>It is a complete testing solution which aims to simplify writing tests and setting up **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Delivery**. Nightwatch can also be used for writing Node.js unit and integration tests. Read more about how Nightwatch was created [here][4].</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning nightwatch">
<i>Nightwatch was created in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and the name was inspired by the famous painting [The Night Watch][4] by Dutch 17th century artist [Rembrandt van Rijn][5]. The masterpiece is prominently displayed in the Rijksmuseum, in Amsterdam.</i>

<p>WebDriver is a general purpose library for automating web browsers. It was started as part of the [Selenium][5] project, which is a popular and comprehensive set of tools for browser automation, initially written for Java but now with support for most programming languages.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
Nightwatch uses the [WebDriver API][6] to perform the browser automation related tasks, like opening windows or clicking links.
</div>

<p>[WebDriver][7] is now a W3C specification aiming to standardise browser automation, providing a platform and a restful HTTP api as a way for web browsers to be remotely controlled.</p>

<h3 id="theory-of-operation"><span>Theory of Operation</span></h3>

Nightwatch works by interacting with a WebDriver-compatible HTTP server (such as [ChromeDriver][8] for Chrome or [GeckoDriver][9] for Firefox). The HTTP protocol is defined by the [W3C WebDriver spec][10], which is derived from [JSON Wire][11] protocol. 

All major browsers have a specific WebDriver implementation, called a driver, which Nightwatch uses behind the scenes to communicate with the browser. See the [Install Webdriver][12] section for details on the particular browser drivers.  

Most of the times, Nightwatch needs to send at least 2 requests to the WebDriver server in order to perform a command or assertion, the first one being the request to locate an element given a CSS selector (or Xpath expression) and the next to perform the actual command/assertion on the given element. See below for an example workflow for browser initialisation.

The communication can also be facilitated by the [Selenium Server][13] (also known as Selenium Grid) or a compatible cloud-based testing platform (like [Browserstack][14], [SauceLabs][15], [CrossBrowserTesting][16], or [LambdaTest][17]).

Nightwatch is sometimes incorrectly described as a "Selenium binding" library. While it's true that Nightwatch can be (and is often) used together with the [Selenium Server][18] it's important to remember that Nightwatch is a complete testing solution which contains a built-in CLI test runner, an extendible command and assertion library, and support for page object model.
